# Is there a Caps game?

## What's it all about?

Simple: you want to know if there's a Washington Capitals game, so you visit this app. It tells you.

## What a great idea!

Yup, I only wish it were mine. I took this idea wholesale from Mark Paschal and his [Is there a Giants game?](http://isthereagiantsga.me/)

## Tell us how to use the app, please

Ok, but let me get it finished. When it goes live, I'll replace this with basic instructions.
