  <h2>What's it all about?</h2>

  <p>First and foremost, the inspiration for this site comes (almost) entirely from <a href="http://markpasc.org/mark/">Mark Paschal</a>. He built the terrific <a href="http://isthereagiantsga.me/">Is there a Giants game?</a>. (If you don&rsquo;t know it already, check it out!)</p>

  <p>The other inspriation was my wife. She&rsquo;s a huge <a href="http://capitals.nhl.com/">Washington Capitals</a> fan, and I thought it would make a fun gift for her if I built a site like Mark's, but for the Caps.</p>

  <h2>This section mostly for geeks</h2>

  <p>The site uses the terrific Ruby framework <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a>. The equally terrific <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> provides the hosting. The source code is available on Github. You can feel free to use the code however you like. Even better, if you can think of any improvements, you can post an issue there or submit a pull request. If you're a Caps fan, but not a geek, you can still help out. If you see anything wrong with the site, let me know <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/telemachus">on Twitter</a>. Otherwise, just enjoy the site.</p>
